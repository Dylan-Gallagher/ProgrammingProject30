This library wraps around JDBC drivers to let you access MySQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.

## Latest Release

This fork has been modified slightly for Processing 3. It's now available in the Contribution Manager in the PDE, or you can install manually by unzipping this folder into your libraries folder:
https://github.com/benfry/sql-library-processing/raw/master/release/BezierSQLib.zip

## Features

It's not an ORM (and will not become one) but it has some handy features
since v0.2.0 that makes it easier to load and save objects to a database.

    setFromRow(object)
    saveToDatabase(object)
    insertUpdateIntoDatabase(table, columns, values)
